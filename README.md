# Hands-On Machine Learning — Chapter Notes (PDF)

This repo is my chapter-wise study notebook for **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow** (Aurélien Géron).

## What’s inside
- 9 folders, one per chapter (1–9)
- Each folder contains **one PDF of my notes**, clearly labeled
- I add pointers (page/section) inside the PDFs so I can quickly revisit specific concepts

> **Copyright note:** This repo contains **my own notes**. It does not include the original book text or the full book PDF.

## Chapters
1. **Chapter 1 — The Machine Learning Landscape**
2. **Chapter 2 — End-to-End ML Project**
3. **Chapter 3 — Classification**
4. **Chapter 4 — Training Models**
5. **Chapter 5 — Support Vector Machines**
6. **Chapter 6 — Decision Trees**
7. **Chapter 7 — Ensemble Learning and Random Forests**
8. **Chapter 8 — Dimensionality Reduction**
9. **Chapter 9 — Unsupervised Learning Techniques**

## File naming convention
Inside each chapter folder:
- `Chapter X — <Title> notes.pdf`

Example:
- `Chapter 3 — Classification/Chapter 3 — Classification notes.pdf`

## Future additions
If I build mini-projects for exercises, I’ll link them from this README later (with code, datasets, and results).
