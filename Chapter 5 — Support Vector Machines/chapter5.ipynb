        "\n",
        "An SVM tries to find a decision boundary (hyperplane) that separates classes while **maximizing the margin** (the distance to the nearest training points). This \"largest-margin\" choice tends to generalize better. With a **soft margin**, it also allows some violations while balancing them against a wider margin using the hyperparameter $C$.\n",

        "\n",
        "A support vector is a training instance that lies **on the margin boundary or inside the margin** (including misclassified points), meaning it directly influences the position of the decision boundary. Points far from the boundary typically have **no effect** on the final model.\n",

        "\n",
        "SVMs rely heavily on **dot products and distances** (especially with kernels like RBF). If features are on very different scales, large-scale features dominate the geometry — distorting margins and kernel similarities. Scaling (e.g., standardization) makes each feature contribute more fairly and usually improves both performance and stability.\n",
